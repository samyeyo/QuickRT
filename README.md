Go to the folder where you have extracted the release package and doubleclick on **QuickRT.exe** in the Windows explorer.

## Getting started

To get you started with QuickRT, type the following commands :

```lua
help("topic")      -- search help for "topic"
clear()            -- clears the screen
a                  -- shows the value of variable 'a'
5+5                -- shows the result of 5+5
print("hello")     -- calls a function and shows its result
pr                 -- type "pr" then press the TAB key to use autocompletion (should find 'print')
sys.exit()         -- exits QuickRT
```
